   - Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
   - Enable 2-Step Verification

2. **Generate an App Password**
   - Visit [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
   - Select "Mail" and your device
   - Copy the generated 16-character password
   - Use this password in your `.env` file

3. **Enable IMAP Access** (for receiving emails)
   - Open Gmail → Settings → See all settings
   - Go to "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" tab
   - Enable IMAP
   - Save Changes

**Gmail Configuration:**
```env
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx  # 16-character app password
SMTP_USE_TLS=true

IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com
IMAP_PORT=993
IMAP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
IMAP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx  # Same app password
IMAP_USE_SSL=true

DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
```

       "email": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/email-send-mcp/main.py"],
         "env": {
           "SMTP_SERVER": "smtp.gmail.com",
           "SMTP_PORT": "587",
           "SMTP_USERNAME": "your-email@gmail.com",
           "SMTP_PASSWORD": "your-app-password",
           "IMAP_SERVER": "imap.gmail.com",
           "IMAP_PORT": "993",
           "IMAP_USERNAME": "your-email@gmail.com",
           "IMAP_PASSWORD": "your-app-password",
           "DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL": "your-email@gmail.com"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Option B: Using .env File** (Simpler)
   
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "email": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/email-send-mcp/main.py"],
         "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/email-send-mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   > This option assumes you have a `.env` file in the project directory.

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

   After updating the configuration, fully quit and restart Claude Desktop.

4. **Verify Integration**

   In Claude Desktop, you should see email tools available. Try asking:
   ```
   Can you help me send an email?
   ```
   
   Claude should recognize it has access to the `send_email` tool.

#### Using Email Tools in Claude Desktop

Once configured, you can use natural language to interact with emails:

**Sending Emails:**
- "Send an email to john@example.com with subject 'Meeting' and tell him about tomorrow's meeting"
- "Email the team about the project update"
- "Send an email with the quarterly report attached"

**Receiving Emails:**
- "Check my inbox for unread emails"
- "Show me the last 10 emails I received"
- "What emails with attachments do I have?"
- "Check my Sent folder"

### Other MCP Clients

This server works with any MCP-compatible client:

#### Custom MCP Client

```python
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

async def main():
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command="python",
        args=["/path/to/email-send-mcp/main.py"],
        env={
            "SMTP_SERVER": "smtp.gmail.com",
            # ... other env vars
        }
    )
    
    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            # Initialize the connection
            await session.initialize()
            
            # List available tools
            tools = await session.list_tools()
            print("Available tools:", tools)
            
            # Call send_email tool
            result = await session.call_tool(
                "send_email",
                arguments={
                    "recipient": "user@example.com",
                    "subject": "Test",
                    "body": "Hello from MCP client!"
                }
            )
            print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### HTTP MCP Client

The server also supports HTTP transport for web-based integrations:

```javascript
// JavaScript/Node.js example
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8888/mcp', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    method: 'tools/call',
    params: {
      name: 'send_email',
      arguments: {
        recipient: 'user@example.com',
        subject: 'Test Email',
        body: 'Hello from HTTP client!'
      }
    },
    id: 1
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result);
```

### Environment Variable Reference for MCP Clients

When configuring MCP clients, these environment variables are required:

**Minimum Required Variables:**
```json
{
  "SMTP_SERVER": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "SMTP_PORT": "587",
  "SMTP_USERNAME": "your-email@gmail.com",
  "SMTP_PASSWORD": "your-app-password",
  "DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL": "your-email@gmail.com"
}
```

**For Email Receiving (Optional):**
```json
{
  "IMAP_SERVER": "imap.gmail.com",
  "IMAP_PORT": "993",
  "IMAP_USERNAME": "your-email@gmail.com",
  "IMAP_PASSWORD": "your-app-password"
}
```

### Troubleshooting MCP Integration

- Solution: Test server manually: `python main.py`

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

Docker provides a containerized way to run the Email MCP Server, ensuring consistency across different environments.

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed ([Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- Docker Compose (optional, for multi-container setups)

### Quick Start with Docker

#### Step 1: Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t email-send-mcp .
```

This creates a Docker image with all dependencies installed.

#### Step 2: Run the Container

**Option A: Using Environment Variables**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name email-mcp \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  -e SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com \
  -e SMTP_PORT=587 \
  -e SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com \
  -e SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password \
  -e IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com \
  -e IMAP_PORT=993 \
  -e IMAP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com \
  -e IMAP_PASSWORD=your-app-password \
  -e DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com \
  email-send-mcp
```

**Option B: Using .env File (Recommended)**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name email-mcp \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  --env-file .env \
  email-send-mcp
```

#### Step 3: Verify Container is Running

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps

# View logs
docker logs email-mcp

# Follow logs in real-time
docker logs -f email-mcp

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8888/api/health
```

### Docker Compose Setup

For easier management, use Docker Compose:

**`docker-compose.yml`:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  email-mcp:
    build: .
    container_name: email-send-mcp
    ports:
      - "8888:8888"
    env_file:
      - .env
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./logs:/app/logs
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8888/api/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
```

**Start with Docker Compose:**
```bash
# Start in background
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Docker Management Commands

```bash
# Stop the container
docker stop email-mcp

# Start the container
docker start email-mcp

# Restart the container
docker restart email-mcp

# Remove the container
docker rm email-mcp

# Remove the image
docker rmi email-send-mcp

# View container logs
docker logs email-mcp --tail 100

# Execute commands inside container
docker exec -it email-mcp /bin/bash

# Inspect container
docker inspect email-mcp
```

### Production Docker Best Practices

1. **Use Multi-Stage Builds** (already in Dockerfile)
2. **Run as Non-Root User** (already configured)
3. **Use Health Checks** (see Docker Compose example)
4. **Mount Logs as Volumes** for persistence
5. **Use Secrets Management** for production credentials
6. **Set Resource Limits:**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name email-mcp \
  --memory="512m" \
  --cpus="0.5" \
  --env-file .env \
  email-send-mcp
```

### Data Flow

#### Sending an Email

```
1. MCP Client → send_email tool call
2. FastMCP Server → validates parameters
3. EmailSender → validates recipient addresses
4. EmailSender → constructs MIME message
5. EmailSender → connects to SMTP server (TLS/SSL)
6. EmailSender → authenticates with credentials
7. EmailSender → sends email
8. EmailSender → returns success/error status
9. FastMCP Server → formats response
10. Response → returns to MCP Client
```

#### Receiving Emails

```
1. MCP Client → receive_emails_imap tool call
2. FastMCP Server → validates parameters
3. EmailReceiver → connects to IMAP server (SSL)
4. EmailReceiver → authenticates with credentials
5. EmailReceiver → selects mailbox/folder
6. EmailReceiver → searches for emails (filtered)
7. EmailReceiver → fetches email messages
8. EmailReceiver → parses email content
9. EmailReceiver → extracts metadata and attachments
10. EmailReceiver → returns formatted email list
11. FastMCP Server → formats response
12. Response → returns to MCP Client
```

### Logging and Monitoring

- **Log Location:** `logs/email-send-mcp_YYYYMMDD.log`
- **Log Rotation:** Daily (midnight)
- **Log Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - logger_name - LEVEL - message`

### Security Architecture

1. **Credential Storage:** Environment variables (never hardcoded)
2. **TLS/SSL:** Enforced for all email connections
3. **Input Validation:** All emails validated before processing
4. **Attachment Validation:** File size and existence checks
5. **Error Handling:** Sensitive data not exposed in errors
6. **Logging:** Passwords and secrets never logged

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Authentication failed" or "Invalid credentials"

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: "535 Authentication failed" or similar
- Cannot connect to SMTP/IMAP server

**Solutions:**
1. **Use App Password instead of regular password**
   - For Gmail: [Create App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
   - For Yahoo: Account Security → Generate app password
   - For Outlook: May need app-specific password or OAuth

2. **Verify credentials in `.env` file**
   ```bash
   # Check your .env file
   cat .env | grep -E "USERNAME|PASSWORD"
   ```

3. **Ensure 2FA is enabled** (required for app passwords)

4. **Check IMAP/SMTP access is enabled**
   - Gmail: Settings → See all settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP → Enable IMAP
   - Outlook: Settings → Sync email → POP and IMAP

---

#### Issue: "Connection timeout" or "Connection refused"

**Symptoms:**
- Server doesn't respond
- Timeout errors after 60+ seconds

**Solutions:**
1. **Check firewall settings**
   ```bash
   # Test SMTP connectivity
   telnet smtp.gmail.com 587
   
   # Test IMAP connectivity
   telnet imap.gmail.com 993
   ```

2. **Verify server addresses and ports**
   - SMTP: Usually port 587 (TLS) or 465 (SSL)
   - IMAP: Usually port 993 (SSL)
   - POP3: Usually port 995 (SSL)

3. **Check if your ISP blocks SMTP/IMAP ports**
   - Some ISPs block port 25, 587
   - Try using VPN or alternative network

4. **Verify TLS/SSL settings match your provider**
   ```env
   # For port 587, use:
   SMTP_USE_TLS=true
   
   # For port 465, use:
   SMTP_USE_TLS=true  # aiosmtplib handles this automatically
   ```

---

#### Issue: Gmail "Less secure app access" error

**Symptoms:**
- "Please log in via your web browser" error
- Account access blocked

**Solutions:**
1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication**
   - Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
   - Turn on 2-Step Verification

2. **Generate and use App Password**
   - Visit [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
   - Select "Mail" and your device
   - Copy the 16-character password
   - Use in `.env` file (remove spaces)

3. **Never use "Less secure app access"** (deprecated and insecure)

---

#### Issue: "Module not found" errors

**Symptoms:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastmcp'
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dotenv'
```

**Solutions:**
```bash

#### Issue: "Permission denied" or "File not found" (attachments)

**Symptoms:**
- "Attachment file not found: /path/to/file.pdf"
- Permission errors when reading attachment files

**Solutions:**
1. **Use absolute paths for attachments**
   ```python
   # ✅ Good
   attachments=["/home/user/documents/report.pdf"]
   
   # ❌ Bad
   attachments=["report.pdf"]
   ```

2. **Verify file exists and is readable**
   ```bash
   ls -la /path/to/file.pdf
   # Should show readable permissions
   ```

3. **Check file size**
   ```bash
   # Default max is 25MB
   du -h /path/to/file.pdf
   ```

         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/email-send-mcp/main.py"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop completely**
   - Quit application (not just close window)
   - Restart from Applications/Start Menu

4. **Check server logs**
   ```bash
   # View logs to see if server started
   tail -f logs/email-send-mcp_*.log
   ```

### Debugging Tips

#### Enable Debug Logging

Add to `.env`:
```env
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
DEBUG=true
```

Restart server and check logs:
```bash
tail -f logs/email-send-mcp_$(date +%Y%m%d).log
```

#### Test SMTP Connection Manually

```python
import asyncio
from src.services.email_sender import EmailSender

async def test():
    sender = EmailSender()
    result = await sender.send_email(
        recipient="test@example.com",
        subject="Test",
        body="Testing SMTP connection"
    )
    print(result)

asyncio.run(test())
```

#### Test IMAP Connection Manually

```python
import asyncio
from src.services.email_receiver import EmailReceiver

async def test():
    receiver = EmailReceiver()
    result = await receiver.receive_emails_imap(limit=1)
    print(result)

asyncio.run(test())
```

#### Check Environment Variables

```bash
# Verify .env is being loaded
python -c "from src.config import get_settings; s = get_settings(); print(f'SMTP: {s.SMTP_SERVER}:{s.SMTP_PORT}')"
```
